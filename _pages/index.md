# Welcome to my digital garden! ðŸŒ±
I am not a fan of soda, but I adore bubbles - the metaphors of ideas in my watery noisy brain.   

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Most of my bubbles are about <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Computational Neuroscience]], [[Statistics]], and [[Machine learning]]</span> (plus random thoughts on books and photography, maybe). 
</p>

This garden is still under construction. 
It was built with [this beautiful jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) and Netlify.
