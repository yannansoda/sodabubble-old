# Data preprocessing pipeline for ML

1.  taking care of missing data
2.  encoding categorical data with dummy variables
3.  splitting datasets into the training and test sets
4.  [[Data preprocessing pipeline for ML#Feature Scaling]] (optional, but beneficial to gradient descent and calculation speed)
	-   two options
		-   standardization = z-score normalization (universal)
		-   normalization (only apply to normal distribution)
				- normalization by dividing maximum
				- mean normalization
	-   donâ€™t apply feature scaling on dummy variables!
