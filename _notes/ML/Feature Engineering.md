### What is **feature engineering** then?
Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning.

### Tips in practice
- missing data: replace NaN by average
- dummy variable trap = Â a scenario in which the independent variables are multicollinear:  -> so, always omit one dummy variable!
