>This is a part of noted from reading the book #Models_of_the_Mind about  [[Computational Neuroscience]].
>This chapter **Cracking the Neural Code** is about visual processing and computer vision.

**1928, Edgar Adrian**
- book 'The Basis of Sensation'
- the interval between spikes matters, rather than the height of the spike

**1941, Shannon**
- information theory

**1952, McColloch & Mackay**
- started linking information theory with neuroscience
-  but they were not sure the theory was implemented in which form of the neural code 

**1968, Bullock & Perkel**
- nervous system represents information

**1967, Richard Stein**
- rate-based code

**1972, Horace Barlow**
- efficient coding: cells should adapt responses to the signals they are receiving to be efficient (adaptation)

**sparse coding**
- to reduce redundancy, only a small number of neurons should be activated at a time
