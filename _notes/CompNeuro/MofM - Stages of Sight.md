**1920, Emanuel Goldberg**
- template matching: multiply image pixels with template pixels and sum up; the best match has highest sum score

**1958, Oliver Selfridge**
- "Pandemonium": hierarchical structures (computational - cognitive - decisional) should be used in visual processing

**1963, Leonard Uhr**
- pattern recognition

**1959, Jerome Lettvin**
- verified "Pandemonium" in frogs

**1960s, Hubel & Wisel**
- simple cell & complex cell

**1960s, Kunihiko Fukushima**
- convolution in visual processing, inspired by Hubel & Wisel
- simulate circuits of simple and complex cells
- "Neocognition" in 1980

**1987, Yann LeCun**
- convolution neural networks in vision, inspired by "Neocognition"
