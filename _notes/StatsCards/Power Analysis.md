[[Statistics]]
### Definition
Power analysis can be used to calculate the minimum sample size required so that one can be reasonably likely to detect an effect of a given size. 

Power values range from 0 to 1, and a common power value is 0.8

### Example
for two groups A and B:

$$d = \frac{\mu_a - \mu_b}{SD_ab}$$
where d is the effect size, $\mu$ is the mean of each group, and SD is the pooled estimated SD.
Then you can Google with the combination of effect size, power, and desired significance threshold.
